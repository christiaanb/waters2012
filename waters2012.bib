          abstract = {C\ensuremath{\lambda}aSH is a functional hardware description language that borrows both its syntax and semantics from the functional programming language Haskell. Polymorphism and higher-order functions provide a level of abstraction and generality that allow a circuit designer to describe circuits in a more natural way than possible with the language elements found in the traditional hardware description languages.

Circuit descriptions can be translated to synthesizable VHDL using the prototype C\ensuremath{\lambda}aSH compiler. As the circuit descriptions, simulation code, and test input are also valid Haskell, complete simulations can be done by a Haskell compiler or interpreter, allowing high-speed simulation and analysis.},
